# Asymmetric Cryptography and Passkey Authentication

## Overview

This project is a practical task for the course Information and Network Security (INE5680) in the Information Systems program at UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina). It involves implementing passkey authentication between a client and multiple servers.

## Task Description

- **Passkey Generation:** The client generates a passkey for server access.
- **Server Authentication:** The client authenticates with the chosen server using the passkey.
- **RSA-OAEP:** Used for authenticated encryption of the file storing client passkeys.
- **Server-side Certificate Storage:** Digital certificates are stored on the server.

## Technologies Used

- **RSA-OAEP**
- **Digital Certificates**
- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
